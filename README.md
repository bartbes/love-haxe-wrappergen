This project uses the awesome [love-api][] project, which provides a lua tables representation of the love documention, to generate Haxe wrappers.
To use this project, make sure to checkout the submodule (git submodule update --init love-api).

Fair warning, the code is awful, and full of hacks. Oh yeah, and unless you have `mkdir -p`, it won't run. Look, it was easy.
